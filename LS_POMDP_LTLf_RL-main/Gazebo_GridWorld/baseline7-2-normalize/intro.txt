Normalize:
    normalized lidar distance between 0 and 1 for all lidar distance vec
    use 1-hot to represent DFA state (set max DFA = 10 for now), use a len10 vector
    normalized rewards:
        - DFA accepted reward = 1/horizon, sum in [0, 1]
        - heuristic reward = (d_{t} - d_{t-1}) / (max_delta_dist * horizon * 10), sum in [-0.1, 0.1]
        - turn cost = 0.0001/horizon, sum in [0, 0.0001]
        - canceled DFA change reward
