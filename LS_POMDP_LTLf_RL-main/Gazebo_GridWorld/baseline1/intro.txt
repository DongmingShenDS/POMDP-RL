This is the first baseline we used
specification: reach (any) object, avoid wall
it supports two types of inputs as observations:
    1. features only (agent location & angle, if near wall, dfa states, etc.)
    2. image + features
this has some early stopping (either reach irreversible dfa or accepted dfa) with some reward design
temp result: not working
insight: image input does not help much and is much slower to train because of the CNN
